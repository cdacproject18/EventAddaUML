Ustad Rashid KhanUSTAD RASHID KHAN
From the Rampur-Sahaswan gharana Ustad Rashid Khan is the great-grandson of gharana founder Inayat Hussain Khan. He has been awarded the Padma Shri, as well as the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 2006. The brilliant Inayat Hussain drut and medium pace khayals ring as true in his voice as they have done down the ages. He is also a master of the tarana like his guru but sings them in his own manner, preferring the khayal style rather than the instrumental stroke-based style for which Nissar Hussain was famous. There is no imitation of instrumental tone in them either. His vocal prowess is in the best tradition of the Rampur Sahaswan gharana. His mastery of all aspects including tonal variations, dynamics and timbre adjustment leave very little to be desired in the realm of voice culture.

Rakesh ChaurasiaRAKESH CHAURASIA
Rakesh Chaurasia, the nephew and child prodigy of flute maestro Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia, has carved a niche for himself, as an accomplished flautist. Incorporating the tradition of his renowned uncle and infusing his personal style, he has evolved a form of music which while maintaining the purity of the flute manages to capture the attention of the young listeners too.

Rakesh's flute has matched note and rhythm with wind instruments of other cultures as well as having performed 'jugalbandis' with Carnatic and world famous instrumentalists. His forte is in blending his flute without really losing its identity in mixed instruments concerts. Rakesh has already globe trotted many times over, enthralling audiences at classical and non-classical concerts. He is also an accomplished studio musician having recorded with most of the leading stalwarts of the Indian film industry.

Rakesh has been the recipient of numerous awards and accolades. He received the Indian Music Academy Award, presented by the Honourable President of India, Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalam in 2007, the Aditya Birla Kalakiran Puraskar in 2008, the Guru Shishya Award in 2011, IWAP-Pandit Jasraj Sangeet Ratna Award in 2013 and the Pannalal Ghosh Puraskar 2013. He has regularly appeared in prominent festivals such as the WOMAD festival in Athens, Womad Earthstation in Europe, the 'Festivals of India' in Russia, Japan, USA, and Europe, Festival of Saint-Denis in Paris and the Leicester International Music Festival in England.

Swar Milap
ARTISTS
Ustad Amjad Ali Khan, Shubha Mudgal, Prasant Samadhar
On the occasion of Late Girija Devi's 89th birthday, Morya Entertainment presents Swar Milap a classical event featuring Amjad Ali Khan, Shubha Mudgal and Prasant Samadar on one stage. They are performing after a long time in Pune, giving a mesmerising feel of classical and semi-classical music.
USTAD AMJAD ALI KHAN
Ustad Amjad Ali Khan was born Masoom Ali Khan in Gwalior, to Hafiz Ali Khan and Rahat Jahan. His father, Hafiz was also an eminent musician in the court of the royal family of Gwalior. Amjad belongs to the Bangash lineage and is the sixth generation of musicians. His great grandfather Ghulam Bandagi Khan Bangash, a soldier of fortune, came from Afghanistan with the instrument rabab and was inducted into the army of the maharaja of Rewa. The king was so impressed by his talent that he took him under his wing and Ghulam Ali was trained under Ustads Pyare Khan and Jafar Khan Saheb, both rabab players and direct descendants of Mian Tansen. Soon Amjad's grandfather Nanhe Khan and father Hafiz Ali Khan, continued the family legacy of the dhrupad and rabibiya tradition and kept improving and altering the rabab, until it became the modern Sarod. Amjad started playing sarod at the age of five but his perception of music developed at the age of three. 
Amjad grew up in a joint family in a house that also included his father's disciples who lived with them as was the tradition in those days. He was the youngest child from his fathers second marriage. Amjad's cousins and siblings could not measure up to his father's expectations who then pinned his hopes on Amjad as the one who would carry on the family legacy, as a result of which he could not enjoy his childhood. The look of joy and pride in his mother's eyes as she encouraged and reminded him of his father's hopes and dreams is what kept Amjad going. He became the breadwinner for the family at a young age, and though circumstances would be financially tough at times, Amjad never stopped his mother from her passion of helping the underprivileged. He got his first big break as a child at the age of 11 in Calcutta at the traditional Sadarang Music conference along with his father and other illustrious musicians. In 1957 at the mere age of 12, Amjad Ali Khan gave his first solo recital and was also the first in his family to receive formal education at Modern school, Delhi. He was in his final year when he left to accompany a troupe of musicians to the US and never looked back.
Amjad Ali Khan has had a successful career spanning over 40 years. He is married to Subhalakshmi, a Bharatanatyam dancer and they have two sons, Amaan and Ayaan, both renowned musicians who often give performances with their father. The family resides in New Delhi, while their Gwalior home has been transformed into a musical center.

Shubha MudgalSHUBHA MUDGAL
Shubha Mudgalhas been trained by some of the finest musicians and musicologists in India. Born into a musically-dedicated family and trained by eminent scholar-musician-composer Pandit Ramashreya Jha Ramrang, she also received guidance from Pandit Vinaya Chandra Maudgalya and Pandit Vasant Thakar. She later learnt stylistic techniques from maestros Pandit Jitendra Abhisheki and Pandit Kumar Gandharva. She also received training in thumri from Smt. Naina Devi and is thus a versatile and popular performer.

In addition to being a performer, Shubha Mudgal is also recognised as a composer. She is the recipient of numerous awards including the Padma Shri in 2000, and the Gold Plaque Award for Special Achievement in Music at the 34th Chicago International Film Festival, 1998, and the Yash Bharati Samman from the Government of Uttar Pradesh in 2015.

She has also been closely involved with several projects related to music education in India. Formerly a member of the Central Advisory Board of Education constituted by the Government of India, Shubha also chaired a focus group discussing the need for introducing an arts education program in mainstream school education during the National Curriculum Framework 2005. Shubha Mudgal was also a Nana Shirgaokar Visiting Research Professor for traditional music at Goa University.
